# Hearing the Word

---

## 1. Why does someone need to hear?

The foundation of salvation is not in human reasoning or effort but in **receiving God’s revealed truth**. Scripture makes it plain:  

> “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.” — **Romans 10:17 (NASB)**  

No one can believe in the Messiah without first being introduced to Him through the message. Salvation is not discovered through philosophy or moral striving — it is **revealed** through the Word.  

**Why hearing is necessary:**  
- **The Word communicates God’s plan of salvation.** Without the gospel, people cannot know the historical truth of Yeshua’s life, death, and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:3–4 NASB).  
- **The Word confronts human blindness.** Sin dulls spiritual perception (2 Corinthians 4:4 NASB: “the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving”). Hearing exposes truth where darkness once prevailed.  
- **The Word awakens responsibility.** To hear is to become accountable. As Yeshua said:  

> “The one who rejects Me and does not accept My teachings has one who judges him; the word which I spoke — that will judge him on the last day.” — **John 12:48 (NASB)**  

Therefore, hearing is not optional — it is God’s appointed gateway to faith and accountability.

## 2. How does it impact them?

Hearing the Word is not a passive intake of information. Scripture teaches it is **spiritually active and life-changing**.  

> “For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit… and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” — **Hebrews 4:12 (NASB)**  

**Impacts of hearing:**  
- **Conviction of sin.** Through the Word, the Spirit brings awareness of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8 NASB).  
- **Creation of faith.** The Word is described as a seed that produces new life:  

> “You have been born again not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.” — **1 Peter 1:23 (NASB)**  

- **Illumination of understanding.**  

> “The unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.” — **Psalm 119:130 (NASB)**  

The Word transforms ignorance into knowledge, confusion into clarity. Hearing impacts both the **mind** (by giving understanding) and the **heart** (by creating conviction and faith).

## 3. Who needs to be the person speaking the Word?

God has ordained that His message be carried by **human messengers**, though the power lies in Him.  

> “How then are they to call on Him in whom they have not believed? How are they to believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?” — **Romans 10:14 (NASB)**  

**Who speaks the Word?**  
- **Ordinary believers.** After persecution in Jerusalem, believers scattered — and:  

> “Those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.” — **Acts 8:4 (NASB)**  

- **Appointed teachers.** God also gifts some as evangelists, pastors, and teachers (Ephesians 4:11 NASB) for building up the body.  
- **God Himself through them.** Ultimately, it is God speaking:  

> “We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us.” — **2 Corinthians 5:20 (NASB)**  

The focus is never on the **status of the messenger** but on the **faithfulness of the message**.

## 4. Are there limits to who can receive?

The Scriptures emphasize that the gospel invitation is **universal**. No race, gender, class, or nation is excluded.  

> “For the Scripture says, ‘Whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.’ For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; for ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’” — **Romans 10:11–13 (NASB)**  

**Key truths:**  
- **No ethnic or cultural boundary.**  

> “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations…” — **Matthew 28:19 (NASB)**  

- **No social boundary.** The gospel reached jailers, slaves, governors, merchants, and kings in the book of Acts.  
- **No spiritual boundary.** Even those considered “outsiders” (Gentiles, Samaritans, tax collectors) were invited.  

The only limitation is the **response of the hearer** — some believe and follow; others harden their hearts (Acts 28:24 NASB).

## 5. How does someone know they have shared enough?

The Bible shows that our role is **faithful proclamation**, not forcing a response.  

> “…we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in trickery nor distorting the word of God, but by the open proclamation of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.” — **2 Corinthians 4:2 (NASB)**  

**Guidance from Scripture:**  
- **Clarity is enough.** The messenger’s responsibility is to clearly communicate the gospel (death, burial, resurrection, and call to repentance).  
- **The Spirit carries it on.** God promises:  

> “…so will My word be which goes out of My mouth; it will not return to Me empty, without accomplishing what I desire.” — **Isaiah 55:11 (NASB)**  

- **Warning is part of love.**  

> “When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not warn him… his blood I will require from your hand. However, if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn… you have saved yourself.” — **Ezekiel 3:18–19 (NASB)**  

**We know we’ve shared enough when we’ve shared faithfully.** The outcome belongs to God.

## 6. Discipleship: From Hearing to Following

Hearing the Word does not end with belief — it is meant to lead to discipleship. A disciple is a **follower, learner, and imitator** of Yeshua (Jesus).  

### a. The Command to Make Disciples  
> “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to follow all that I commanded you…” — **Matthew 28:19–20 (NASB)**  

- Salvation is not the end goal; discipleship is.  
- Discipleship includes baptism, teaching, and obedience.  

### b. What It Means to Be a Disciple  
- **Abiding in His Word** — *“If you continue in My word, then you are truly My disciples.”* — **John 8:31 (NASB)**  
- **Loving Others** — *“By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.”* — **John 13:35 (NASB)**  
- **Bearing Fruit** — *“My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.”* — **John 15:8 (NASB)**  
- **Taking Up the Cross** — *“If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me.”* — **Luke 9:23 (NASB)**  

Discipleship is not mere intellectual belief — it is life transformation and obedience.

### c. Who Is Called to Be a Disciple?  
- Every believer is called, not just leaders or teachers.  
- The early church followed this model:  

> “They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.” — **Acts 2:42 (NASB)**  

### d. The Purpose of Discipleship  
- To grow in the likeness of Messiah:  

> “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” — **Romans 8:29 (NASB)**  

- To multiply the message:  

> “The things which you have heard from me… entrust these to faithful people who will be able to teach others also.” — **2 Timothy 2:2 (NASB)**

# Chapter 2 – Why We Are Having These Challenges Today

## Introduction  
From ancient Israel to our modern world, people have often chosen the rule of men over the reign of God (Adonai Elohim). When we do this, we find ourselves enslaved to violence, vanity, and corruption. Scripture shows that these troubles are not new—they were foretold. Yet we are not left without hope: if we return to Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach), we can walk in peace that is not dependent on the systems of this world.

## Human Desire for Rule  
When the prophet Samuel grew old, Israel rejected God’s direct reign and demanded a king to be like other nations. God warned them what this would mean—conscription, taxation, war, and oppression—but they refused to listen.

> “…they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being King over them.” (1 Samuel 8:7 [NASB])

Even today, humanity repeats this mistake: trusting in men, governments, and institutions rather than in God Himself.

## The Consequences of Choosing Man Over God  
Samuel warned the people that kings would “take” their sons, daughters, fields, and possessions, and rule by force (1 Samuel 8:11–18 [KJV]). This prophecy continues to play out in our own times:  
- Governments wage perpetual wars.  
- Nations consume the fruits of their citizens’ labor.  
- Institutions enforce laws by violence, coercion, and fear.  

Ecclesiastes reminds us that all the striving of men, even under great wisdom, ends in futility:

> “Vanity of vanities! All is vanity. What advantage does a person have in all his work which he does under the sun?” (Ecclesiastes 1:2–3 [NASB])  

Human laws, however sophisticated, cannot bring lasting peace. They are “a chasing after wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:14 [NASB]).

## Peace Without Violence  
Here lies a foundational truth: **no truly good idea requires violence to be enforced.** Man’s laws are backed by threat—fines, imprisonment, or worse. But God’s kingdom is different:  

> “For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.” (Romans 14:17 [NASB])

The Mosaic Law had a divine purpose: not to save, but to expose sin and point to the coming Messiah. It was a schoolmaster leading us to Christ (Galatians 3:24 [NASB]). In Him, peace comes not by compulsion, but by transformation:  

> “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2 [NASB])

---

## Turning Our Focus Back to God  
The problem is not only governments but also religious institutions that exalt their own laws above the Word of God. Like the Pharisees and Sadducees, they substitute tradition for truth. But Scripture calls us individually:

> “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2 Timothy 2:15 [NASB])

We are not called to delegate our eternity to corrupt leaders but to know God personally, through His Word and through His Son, Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach).

## Application: The Call to Choose Wisely  
The lesson of Israel’s demand for a king is timeless: when we choose men over God, we reap oppression, violence, and futility. Samuel’s warning could not have been clearer:  

> “This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and place them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots. He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties, and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots. He will also take your daughters for perfumers, cooks, and bakers. And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. He will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. He will also take your male slaves and your female slaves, and your best young men and your donkeys, and use them for his work. He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants. Then you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you on that day.” (1 Samuel 8:11–18 [NASB])  

This warning is as relevant now as it was then. When we place our trust in human kings and governments, they inevitably take, consume, and enslave. But when we choose God’s reign, we gain peace beyond circumstance. Our challenge today is not new—it is the same choice Israel faced. Will we look to human kings and systems, or will we yield to the eternal King of kings?

### Summary  
We face today’s challenges because humanity continues to reject God’s reign in favor of man’s rule. Governments and institutions operate by violence and vanity, while God offers peace and righteousness through Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach). True freedom and lasting peace are found not in kings or laws, but in turning our hearts fully to Adonai Elohim and walking as His children.

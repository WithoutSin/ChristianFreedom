# Chapter 4: The Prophecy of the Law --- What Does It Mean to Be Fulfilled?

## 4.1 God Is the Righteous Judge (Romans 2:1--11)

Romans 2:1--11 \[NASB\]:

> 1 Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment,
> for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who
> judge practice the same things. 2 And we know that the judgment of God
> rightly falls upon those who practice such things. 3 But do you
> suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such
> things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of
> God? 4 Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and
> tolerance and patience, not k...

This section makes it clear: **God is the righteous judge**. Human
judgment is faulty, because mankind is prone to hypocrisy. Paul
highlights that those who condemn others often practice the same sins
themselves. True judgment belongs only to God, whose judgment is
impartial, righteous, and all-encompassing.

To the unbeliever, this exposes their foolishness: those who do not
believe in God are prone to commit the very sins they condemn. To the
believer, it offers hope: God's **kindness, tolerance, and patience**
lead us to repentance, not to condemnation. His judgment is perfect, but
His grace invites us into reconciliation before the day of wrath.

Other passages confirm this truth:

-   Matthew 7:1--2 --- "Do not judge so that you will not be judged. For
    in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of
    measure, it will be measured to you."
-   James 4:12 --- "There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is
    able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your
    neighbor?"
-   John 5:22 --- "For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has
    given all judgment to the Son."

These passages reinforce the lesson: **we are not called to sit in
judgment over others**, for judgment belongs to God alone.

## 4.2 The Law Written on Hearts (Romans 2:12--16)

Romans 2:12--16 \[NASB\]:

> 12 For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without
> the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the
> Law; 13 for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God,
> but the doers of the Law will be justified. 14 For when Gentiles who
> do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not
> having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15 in that they show the work
> of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness
> and their thoughts alter...

Even Gentiles, without the written Mosaic Law, reveal its reality when
they obey their consciences. The Law of God was always more than written
commandments --- it was **written on hearts** from creation.

Jeremiah 31:33 \[NASB\] prophesies this very truth:

> "But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel
> after those days," declares the LORD, "I will put My law within them
> and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they
> shall be My people."

The fulfillment of this prophecy is found in the Messiah, Jesus Christ,
who brings judgment and righteousness not through tablets of stone, but
through the living transformation of the heart.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.3 The Hypocrisy of Boasting in the Law (Romans 2:17--24)

Paul confronts those who boast in possessing the Law but fail to keep
it. The Law was given to be a guide, a light, and an embodiment of
truth, but Israel's failure in obedience led to dishonor before the
nations.

Romans 2:23--24 \[NASB\]:

> "You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you
> dishonor God? For 'THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES
> BECAUSE OF YOU,' just as it is written."

The Law exposes hypocrisy: it shows that no amount of outward boasting,
teaching, or ritual (such as circumcision) makes one righteous before
God.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.4 Circumcision of the Heart (Romans 2:25--29)

This section shows that true covenantal identity is not in outward marks
of the flesh, but in the **heart transformed by God's Spirit**.

Romans 2:28--29 \[NASB\]:

> "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that
> which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly;
> and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by
> the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God."

Circumcision of the flesh was never the goal --- it was a sign pointing
to the deeper reality: **faithful obedience from the heart**. This sets
the stage for Paul's revelation of justification by faith.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.5 The Purposes of the Law

The Law had multiple purposes, each woven into God's redemptive plan.

### 4.5.1 To Expose Sin and Condemn It in the Flesh

Romans 3:20 \[NASB\]:

> "because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His
> sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin."

The Law reveals God's holiness and our failure. It condemns sin in the
flesh, showing us that salvation cannot come through works but only
through faith in God's Word.

Romans 7:7 \[NASB\]:

> "I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would
> not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, 'YOU SHALL NOT
> COVET.'"

The Law exposes the reality of sin --- but offers no power to overcome
it.

### 4.5.2 To Prove the Messiah

Jesus Christ did not break the Law. He fulfilled it by embodying its
heart and purpose.

Matthew 5:17 \[NASB\]:

> "Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did
> not come to abolish but to fulfill."

Galatians 3:24 \[NASB\]:

> "Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that
> we may be justified by faith."

By keeping the Law perfectly, Jesus proved Himself to be the promised
Messiah --- the only one able to stand blameless under its demands.

### 4.5.3 To Protect the Bloodline of the Messiah

The Law preserved Israel as a distinct people, safeguarding the lineage
of David until the Messiah, Jesus Christ, came.

Isaiah 11:1 \[NASB\]:

> "Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a branch from
> his roots will bear fruit."

Romans 9:4--5 \[NASB\]:

> "who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the
> glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple
> service and the promises, whose are the fathers, and from whom is the
> Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever.
> Amen."

Through the Law, God preserved the covenant people until the fullness of
time when Christ was born.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.6 Justification by Faith, Not the Law

Romans 4:1--3 \[NASB\]:

> "What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the
> flesh, has found? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has
> something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the
> Scripture say? 'ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS
> RIGHTEOUSNESS.'"

Abraham was justified before the Law was given. His righteousness was by
**faith in God's words**, not works of the flesh.

Moses, too, was counted righteous before Sinai. He believed God, obeyed
His voice, and led the people out of Egypt before the written Law was
established (Hebrews 11:24--29).

Romans 10:4 \[NASB\]:

> "For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to everyone who
> believes."

This means the Law was never able to provide righteousness. The Law
reveals sin; faith in God's Word brings righteousness. Jesus Christ, the
Word made flesh, is the fulfillment of that faith.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.7 Peace with God Through Christ (Romans 5:1--11)

"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we also have obtained our
introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we
celebrate in hope of the glory of God." (Romans 5:1--2 \[NASB\])

### 1. Tribulation and Hope

Peace with God does not mean freedom from hardship, but rather a
transformed relationship with trials. Tribulation is no longer
punishment, but refining.

-   **Romans 5:3--5 \[NASB\]**: "And not only this, but we also
    celebrate in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about
    perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven
    character, hope; and hope does not disappoint, because the love of
    God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit
    who was given to us."\
-   **James 1:2--3 \[NASB\]**: "Consider it all joy, my brothers and
    sisters, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing
    of your faith produces endurance."

Through peace with God, trials no longer destroy us --- they build us.

### 2. The Demonstration of God's Love

Our peace with God rests on the deepest possible assurance: Christ died
for us not when we were righteous, but when we were sinners.

-   **Romans 5:6--8 \[NASB\]**: "For while we were still helpless, at
    the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die
    for a righteous person; though perhaps for the good person someone
    would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us,
    in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."\
-   **John 15:13 \[NASB\]**: "Greater love has no one than this, that a
    person will lay down his life for his friends."

The love of God is the foundation of our peace.

### 3. Reconciliation and Salvation

Peace with God is more than the absence of conflict; it is
reconciliation and restored relationship.

-   **Romans 5:9--11 \[NASB\]**: "Much more then, having now been
    justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God
    through Him. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God
    through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we
    shall be saved by His life. And not only this, but we also celebrate
    in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now
    received the reconciliation."\
-   **Colossians 1:19--20 \[NASB\]**: "For it was the Father's good
    pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, and through Him to
    reconcile all things to Himself, whether things on earth or things
    in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross."

Justification takes away guilt; reconciliation restores fellowship;
salvation secures eternal peace.

### 4. The Contrast Between Adam and Christ

Paul expands the meaning of peace by contrasting Adam's sin with
Christ's obedience. One brought death and separation; the other brings
life and reconciliation.

-   **Romans 5:18--19 \[NASB\]**: "So then, as through one offense the
    result was condemnation to all mankind, so also through one act of
    righteousness the result was justification of life to all mankind.
    For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made
    sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be
    made righteous."\
-   **1 Corinthians 15:22 \[NASB\]**: "For as in Adam all die, so also
    in Christ all will be made alive."

Our peace with God is not fragile or circumstantial --- it is rooted in
Christ's obedience that undid Adam's fall.

### 5. Practical Application of Peace with God

Peace with God is not only a theological truth, but a daily reality for
those who believe.

-   **Romans 8:1 \[NASB\]**: "Therefore there is now no condemnation at
    all for those who are in Christ Jesus."\
-   **John 14:27 \[NASB\]**: Jesus said, "Peace I leave you, My peace I
    give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your
    hearts be troubled, nor fearful."\
-   **1 John 3:1 \[NASB\]**: "See how great a love the Father has given
    us, that we would be called children of God; and in fact we are."

Peace with God means no longer striving under the Law, no longer enemies
but children, no longer fearful but confident in His love.

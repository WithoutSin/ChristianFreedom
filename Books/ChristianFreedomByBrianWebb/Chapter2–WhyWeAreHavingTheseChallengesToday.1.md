# Chapter 2 – Why we are having these challenges today
**1 Samuel 8 King James Version (KJV)**
>1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.<br />
2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.<br />
3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.<br />
4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,<br />
5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.<br />
6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.<br />
7 And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.<br />
8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.<br />
9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.<br />

And God tried to warn the people. I keep hearing, “Why didn’t God say something?” I say “Why are you not listening?”
>10 And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king.<br />
11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.<br />
12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.<br />
13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.<br />
14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.<br />
15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.<br />
16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.<br />
17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.<br />
18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day.

Every time I hear that God’s judgment is not just or loving I keep thinking back to how many times He has warned His people, even today, and they still decide to walk off the cliff, and then blame God. Just so you know, that is what the term rile again God, and gnashing of teeth are all about. The people are complaining that God isn’t their servant, and that they decided to not listen to God, so they complain and gnash teeth against God.

And look what the people did after the warning.
>19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;<br />
20 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.<br />
21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.<br />
22 And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.

You see the problem here is that we have chosen men over God I and even when it came to the men of God we chose Sadducees and Pharisees over learning about God Himself.

**2 Timothy 2:15 King James Version (KJV)**<br />
>15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

So if we are to study why are we delegating our eternity to a few, who like the Judges of 1st Samuel who were taking bribes to change the ruling of God?

Let’s look at modern government, it is in perpetual war, perpetually taking the fruits of our labor I entity or young men into their wary. We have fulfilled the warning of God thousands of years ago today.

But it isn’t just government, how many organized churches condemn people by their church laws that they disobey? When you read the book of Ecclesiastes you realize that all your diligence and labor under the law is all vanity, everything is a wisp.

**Ecclesiastes 1 King James Version (KJV)**
>1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.<br />
2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.<br />
3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?<br />
4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth forever.<br />
5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.<br />
6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.<br />
7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.<br />
8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.<br />
9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.<br />
10 Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already of old time, which was before us.<br />
11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.

Notice 11, there is no remembrance of former things, even when someone has some glorious idea, but it fails. The problem was that it may have been idealistic, or bold, but it wasn’t right.

Here lies a truism, no good ideas need to be enforced by violence. All laws of men are laws of violence. That is if you do not obey, you will be held in contempt, you will be fined, and if you still refuse, you will be tossed into a cage, or killed.

>12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.<br />
13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.<br />
14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.<br />
15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.<br />
16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.<br />
17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.<br />
18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

See that. The king of Jerusalem sought out great wisdom and works, and in the end, it is all a wisp, vanity, nothing. That is the laws of men. They act as though they are a great wisdom, and it is for nothing.

So what of the Mosaic Law? Why did God give us the Law? Is it any different than the laws of men?

The law was to expose and fully make known sin, to show the coming Christ, to educate us as our school master until the new master comes. The law was the prophecy of the coming Christ. I will cover more of this in the Chapter 4: The Prophesy of the Law, and how it was fulfilled.

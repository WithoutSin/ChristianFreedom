# Chapter 7: Historical Evidence of Jesus the Messiah
Here’s a survey of the principal non‑biblical (and early Christian) sources that attest to Jesus’ historical existence, His resurrection, and (to a lesser extent) His ascension:

## 1. Sources for Jesus’ Existence
1. Flavius Josephus (c. 37 - c. 100 AD), Antiquities 18.3.3<br/>
    “Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man… He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ. And when Pilate… condemned Him to the cross, those who had loved Him at the first did not forsake Him; for He appeared to them alive again on the third day…”<br/><br/>
    Note: This so‑called “Testimonium Flavianum” is probably partly Christian‑interpolated, but most scholars agree it preserves an authentic core reference to Jesus and His followers.<br/><br/>
2. Tacitus (c. 56 - c. 120 AD), Annals 15.44<br/>
    “Christus, from whom the name [“Christians”] had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of… Pontius Pilate.”<br/><br/>
3. Pliny the Younger (c. 61 - c. 113 AD), Letter to Trajan (c. 112 AD)<br/>
    Pliny describes early Christians worshiping “Christ as God” and meeting “on a fixed day before dawn and singing… a hymn to Christ as to a god.”<br/><br/>
4. Suetonius (c. 69 - c. 122 AD), Lives of the Caesars, Claudius 25.4<br/>
    Refers to disturbances at Rome “caused by Chrestus,” almost certainly a misspelling of Christus (Christ).<br/><br/>
5. Babylonian Talmud (c. 200-500 AD), Sanhedrin 43a<br/>
    Mentions “Yeshu” who was hanged on the eve of Passover—reflecting Jewish awareness of a Jesus executed under Roman authority.<br/><br/>

## 2. Sources for the Resurrection
1. Paul’s Early Creed (1 Corinthians 15:3-8, c. AD 55)<br/>
    “Christ died for our sins … He was buried, … He was raised on the third day… He appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the Twelve, then to more than five hundred…”<br/><br/>
    Note: This formula predates Paul’s letter by several years and is our earliest attestation of post‑resurrection appearances.<br/><br/>
2. Josephus (Antiquities 18.3.3, as above)<br/>
As quoted above, Josephus’ passage (even if partially redacted) includes “He appeared to them alive again on the third day.”<br/><br/>
3. Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 AD), First Apology 29<br/>
    Affirms that Christians worship “the crucified Jesus, who… rose from the dead by the will of the Father.”<br/><br/>
4. Origen (c. 185-254 AD), Against Celsus 2.56<br/>
    Cites a witness tradition that the tomb was found empty and that Mary Magdalene and others saw the risen Lord.<br/><br/>

## 3. Sources for the Ascension
1. Luke–Acts (c. AD 60-62)<br/>
    Acts 1:9–11 gives the most detailed NT account: Jesus “was lifted up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. … ‘This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way.’”<br/><br/>
2. Early Creeds & Liturgies<br/>
    * **1 Timothy 3:16** (c. AD 60–65) contains an early confession: “He was manifested in the flesh… was vindicated… was seen by angels… was preached among the nations… was believed on in the world… was taken up in glory.”<br/>
    * **Apostles’ Creed** (late 2nd–3rd century) likewise affirms “He ascended into heaven; and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty.”<br/>
3. Patristic Writers<br/>
    * **Irenaeus (c. 130–202 AD), Against Heresies 3.21.1,** speaks of Jesus’ bodily ascension as the guarantee of believers’ own future bodily resurrection and glorification.<br/>

## 4. Summary of Historical Attestation
Aspect Earliest Source & Date Key Point

* **Existence** Josephus Ant. 18.3.3 (c. 93 AD) Jesus, as a wise teacher, was crucified by Pilate, had followers who believed He rose. <br/>
* **Resurrection** 1 Cor 15:3-8 (c. 55 AD)Creed listing post‑resurrection appearances to Peter, the Twelve, 500+ people. <br/>
* **Ascension** Luke’s Acts 1:9-11 (c. 60–62 AD); 1 Tim 3:16 Jesus “taken up” into heaven; affirmed in early creeds.<br/>

## 5. Conclusion
Taken together, both **Jewish** and **Roman** historians of the 1st–2nd centuries independently confirm:

1. **Jesus’ life and crucifixion** under Pontius Pilate.
2. **Early Christian belief** in the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact.
3. **Widespread worship** of Christ “as God,” driven by the conviction that He rose and ascended.

While the **miraculous elements** (empty tomb, appearances, ascension) are primarily attested within Christian writings, the **rapid growth** of the movement, even under persecution, lends strong indirect support to their early historicity.

# Chapter 1 – The Philosophy (Expanded for Christians)

## Introduction  
Freedom is often understood in political or social terms—“when no one is forcing their will on you.” This is true on a human level, yet Scripture reveals that even if you escape the domination of men or governments, you are still enslaved to time, sin, and death. True **Christian freedom** comes not from self-ownership but from being adopted as children of God (Adonai Elohim) through Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach), who grants eternal life and liberty beyond the limits of this world.

## Human Philosophy of Freedom  
In his publication *Freedom!* Adam Kokesh defines freedom as “what you have when no one is forcing their will on you” (thefreedomline.com). The principle of **non-aggression**—not harming, stealing from, or coercing another—does create a measure of peace in society. Yet, even if we achieve a perfectly just society, death itself still robs us of freedom. Thus, human philosophy stops short of solving our deepest problem: bondage to sin and mortality.

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.” (John 8:34 [NASB])

## The Tyranny of Time and Death  
No matter how well we manage ourselves or resist external tyranny, time enslaves us. The universe itself will one day come to an end. Man cannot make himself eternal. This is why the freedom Christ (Messiah) offers is infinitely greater than human liberty—it is freedom from sin and death.

> “So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.” (John 8:36 [NASB])

## Christian Freedom: Children, Not Slaves  
Christian freedom does not mean becoming a slave of God (Adonai Elohim) in the same way one is a slave to sin. Rather, it is adoption into the family of God, where we live as beloved children.

> “See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and in fact we are.” (1 John 3:1 [NASB])

A loving parent nurtures, protects, and raises up their child. So too does our Father in heaven. This changes everything: obedience is not forced servitude but joyful fellowship.

## Oikonomia: Stewardship in Scripture  
The Greek word *oikonomia* (often translated “stewardship,” “administration,” or “management”) appears in several key passages. Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach) uses it in His parable of the unrighteous steward:

> “There was a certain rich man, which had a steward (*oikonomos*); and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods…” (Luke 16:1 [KJV]; see Luke 16:1–9 for the full parable)

Paul uses *oikonomia* to describe his own role as a steward of the gospel:

- **1 Corinthians 9:17** – “…I have a stewardship entrusted to me.” [NASB]  
- **Ephesians 3:2** – “…the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you.” [NASB]  
- **Colossians 1:25** – “…a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit.” [NASB]  
- **1 Timothy 1:4** – “…rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith.” [NASB]  

Paul was entrusted with managing the proclamation of Messiah’s grace. We, as recipients, are not the managers but the heirs who benefit from faithful stewardship. This means our Christian freedom is not earned by our labor but given through Messiah’s completed work.

## Application: A Lord Worth Following  
A lord who rules by force and aggression enslaves. But Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach), who gave His life freely and offers liberty from sin, is a Lord worth following. He does not violate the principle of love and peace but fulfills it perfectly. He is the steward of eternal freedom, and in Him we share its fruits.

### Summary  
True freedom is not only the absence of human coercion but the deliverance from sin, death, and the tyranny of time. Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach) brings us into this freedom—not as slaves, but as children of God (Adonai Elohim) who inherit eternal life. As Paul received stewardship of this mystery, we now walk in its blessings. When we embrace Messiah’s gift, we discover that the ultimate freedom is found not in self-ownership, but in belonging to the One who conquered death and calls us His own.

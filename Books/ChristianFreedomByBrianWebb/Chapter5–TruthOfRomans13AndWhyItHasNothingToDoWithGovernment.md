# Chapter 5: Truth of Romans 13, and Why It Has Nothing to Do with Government  

## 1. Introduction: Context Matters  
Before diving into Romans 13, remember that chapter and verse breaks were not in the original Word. The original manuscripts were handwritten letters without numbered sections. These breaks were added by men later to help study and reference, but men can and do make mistakes.  

Romans 13 opens abruptly with what seems like a command: *“Let every person be subject to the governing authorities.”* At first glance, this appears contradictory to the truth Paul laid out earlier — that the Law cannot make flesh righteous. So why a command?  

The answer lies in context. If you look back into Romans 11 and 12, you see a consistent flow of thought. Romans 12 doesn’t just open a new theme; it builds on 11 and leads into 13. Therefore, the “governing authorities” of chapter 13 must be understood in the context of God’s order, not human governments.

## 2. Romans 12: A Foundation for Romans 13  

Romans 12 [NASB] says:  
> *“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.”*  

Paul then exhorts believers to love without hypocrisy, abhor evil, cling to good, serve with diligence, persevere in tribulation, bless persecutors, live at peace with all, avoid revenge, and overcome evil with good.  

The imagery of *“heaping burning coals on your enemy’s head”* (Romans 12:20) is not about destroying an enemy but about blessing them. Ancient travelers carried warm coals wrapped in cloth on their heads to stay warm in cold journeys. By giving them coals, you gave them life and comfort.  

This spirit of peace, blessing, and overcoming evil with good continues into chapter 13.

## 3. Romans 13:1–7 in Context

Romans 13:1–7 [NASB]:  
> *“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.”*  

The question is this: *What authorities?* Are these political rulers, or is Paul pointing back to the authority of God manifested through His body?  

Paul is not contradicting himself. Romans 12 makes clear that believers live free, blessing enemies and submitting to God’s ways. Romans 13 continues the theme: true authority flows from God alone. No man — not emperor, governor, or king — holds real authority apart from God.  

When read in context, Romans 13 is about respecting God’s order and His ministers (those serving righteously), not about blind obedience to governments of men.

## 4. Old Testament Examples of Righteous Disobedience

* The Hebrew Midwives (Exodus 1:15–21)<br/>
Pharaoh commanded the midwives to kill Hebrew boys at birth. They feared God instead, sparing the children. God rewarded their disobedience with households of their own. Their loyalty was not to Pharaoh but to God.
* Moses Before Pharaoh (Exodus 5–12)<br/>
Moses repeatedly defied Pharaoh’s decrees, obeying God’s command to deliver His people. Each plague demonstrated that true authority belongs to the LORD, not the king of Egypt.
* Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (Daniel 3:16–18)<br/>
Ordered to bow to Nebuchadnezzar’s golden image, they refused, declaring, “Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us… But even if He does not… we are not going to serve your gods.” God honored their faith and delivered them from the fiery furnace.
* Daniel in the Lions’ Den (Daniel 6:10–23)<br/>
When prayer to God was outlawed, Daniel prayed openly three times a day as before. His faithfulness to God above man’s law led to deliverance in the lions’ den.
* The Prophets Confronting Kings<br/>
Elijah rebuked Ahab for idolatry (1 Kings 18). Nathan rebuked David for his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12). Prophets consistently defied kings when kings defied God.

These examples prove a consistent biblical truth: when man’s law contradicts God’s law, God must be obeyed first.

## 5. False Authorities vs. God’s Authority  
If all true authority comes from God, then all false authority must come from somewhere else. Which man can create life from dust? Which ruler can give eternal righteousness? None, except Jesus Christ.  

Therefore, when Paul says, *“whoever resists authority resists the ordinance of God,”* he is not endorsing Caesar or empire. He is saying that to resist God’s true authority is to resist God Himself.  

This verse has been pulled out of context for centuries to justify statism, political obedience, and tyranny. Yet the apostles themselves regularly disobeyed governments when those governments contradicted God’s commands. Paul was beaten, jailed, and executed by political authorities. Jesus Himself was condemned by rulers who claimed false authority.

## 6. Witness of the Apostles: Obedience to God over Men  
Acts 5:29 [NASB]:  

> *“But Peter and the apostles answered, ‘We must obey God rather than men.’”*  

This simple truth overturns any interpretation of Romans 13 that demands blind allegiance to earthly rulers. The apostles understood that their allegiance belonged only to the Lord.  

The governing authorities Paul writes of, then, are those walking in God’s ways — His servants for good, not for evil.

## 7. 1st Peter 2: Be Subject for the Lord’s Sake  

1 Peter 2:13–17 [NASB]:  
> *“Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.”*  

At first glance, Peter seems to echo the statist reading. But look closer.  

The emphasis is: *“For the Lord’s sake.”* Believers are free men and women, not slaves of men. Their subjection is about witness and accountability, not blind obedience.  

Peter ends with a crucial order: *“Fear God. Honor the king.”* Fear belongs only to God. The king receives honor, but never worship. God’s people live free under Him alone.

## 8. Give to Caesar What Belongs to Caesar  
Romans 13:7 [NASB]:  

> *“Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.”*  

Jesus Himself spoke similarly in Matthew 22:21 [NASB]:  

> *“Then He said to them, ‘Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.’”*  

Jesus pointed to a Roman coin stamped with Caesar’s image. Caesar could have his coin; God requires the heart, the soul, the very life stamped with His image.  

Believers are free from bondage to money, power, and rulers. If paying tax avoids unnecessary conflict, then pay it. But never forget: your true provision comes from God, not from Caesar.

## 9. Prophetic Warnings Against Corrupt Rulers
The prophets consistently declared that rulers who oppressed the people, shed innocent blood, or turned from God’s covenant were under divine judgment.
* Isaiah 1:23 [NASB] — “Your rulers are rebels and companions of thieves; Everyone loves a bribe and chases after gifts. They do not obtain justice for the orphan, nor does the widow’s case come before them.”
* Jeremiah 22:13 [NASB] — “Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness, And his upstairs rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor’s services without pay And does not give him his wages.”
* Ezekiel 22:27 [NASB] — “Her leaders within her are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood and destroying lives in order to make dishonest profit.”
* Micah 3:1–2 [NASB] — “Hear now, you leaders of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know justice? You who hate good and love evil…”
* The prophets remind us that earthly power often stands in opposition to God’s justice. Thus, Romans 13 cannot be a command to honor tyranny, but to discern true authority that reflects God’s order.

## 10. Living as the Body of Christ  
Romans 12 and 13 flow into one another. The Body of Christ is called to live in unity, humility, peace, generosity, and fearless obedience to God. This is the real meaning of being “subject to authority.”  

To live under God’s authority is to walk in His Spirit. This brings freedom, not slavery. The rulers of men may claim ownership of your wages, your property, even your body. But they cannot touch your true life hidden in Christ.  

Therefore, let us live not as slaves of men, but as free servants of the Lord — working together, supporting one another, and storing up treasures in heaven, not in the vaults of Caesar.

## 11. Summary  
Romans 13 has been misused for centuries to demand blind obedience to rulers, yet Scripture testifies otherwise. True authority belongs to God alone, and His people are called to live as **free servants of Christ**, not slaves of men. From the Hebrew midwives and Daniel to the apostles themselves, God’s people have always resisted tyranny when it contradicted His commands. To submit to the “governing authorities” is to submit to those who walk in God’s ways, not to every human decree. As followers of Jesus Christ, we must walk in faith, courage, and discernment — honoring all, fearing God above all, and living out the freedom of the gospel. In this way, we silence ignorance, overcome evil with good, and shine as witnesses to the true King of kings.

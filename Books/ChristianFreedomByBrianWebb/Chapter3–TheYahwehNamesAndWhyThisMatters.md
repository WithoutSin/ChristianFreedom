# Chapter 3 – The Yahweh Names, and Why Each Matters

## Introduction  
If we are to call ourselves Christians, we must know the One who called us. Just as a child honors his father by knowing his character, so must we learn the names of God (Adonai Elohim). Each name reveals His nature, His covenant, and His work toward us. To claim His name without knowing Him is to live shallowly; but to understand His names is to walk in His truth and strength.

## Why God’s Names Matter  
In the ancient world, a name was more than a label — it revealed identity, character, and purpose. God’s names tell us not only what He has done, but also who He is. By learning these names, we guard against creating a god of our own imagination. Instead, we root our faith in the God who has revealed Himself through Scripture and who fulfilled these revelations in Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach).

## God’s Names in Scripture  

### **Elohim – God the Creator**  
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1 [NASB])  
Elohim speaks of God’s might and creative power. All other rulers are under His authority. Pharaohs, kings, and presidents rise and fall by His will, but Elohim remains above all.

---

### **Adonai – My Lord, My Master**  
“‘A son honors his father, and a servant his master. Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My respect?’ says the Lord of hosts…” (Malachi 1:6 [NASB])  

The word *Adone* means “Lord.” Adding the suffix *-ai* changes the meaning to “My Lord.” Thus, Adonai emphasizes God’s personal Lordship over the believer — not just “a Lord,” but *my* Lord and Master.  

Adonai calls us to honor Him not with leftovers, but with wholehearted love. He is not mocked; He expects from His children the same righteousness and compassion He has shown us.

### **Jehovah-Elohim – Lord of Creation**  
“This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.” (Genesis 2:4 [NASB])  
God is not a distant artist but the Builder who created for sharing. His metaphors — Potter, Farmer, Shepherd — remind us He creates with purpose, shaping us for His glory.

---

### **Jehovah-Qadash – The Lord Who Sanctifies**  
“…you shall surely observe My sabbaths; for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you.” (Exodus 31:13 [NASB])  
Holiness is God’s gift. He sets apart His people not by our righteousness but by His covenant. The Sabbath reminded Israel that their identity was rooted in His sanctifying power.

---

### **Jehovah-Ra’ah – The Lord My Shepherd, My Provider**  
“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.” (Psalm 23:1 [NASB])  
Like sheep cared for by a shepherd, we are fed, guided, and protected. Even when we wander into the valley of the shadow of death, His rod and staff comfort us.

---

### **Jehovah-Nissi – The Lord Our Banner**  
“Moses built an altar and named it The Lord is My Banner.” (Exodus 17:15 [NASB])  
A banner rallies soldiers to unity and direction. God Himself is our rallying point. In Him we find identity, protection, and victory.

---

### **Jehovah-Shammah – The Lord Who Is Present**  
“…and the name of the city from that day shall be, ‘The Lord is there.’” (Ezekiel 48:35 [NASB])  
God is not absent from His people. He reveals His presence, guiding and sustaining us even in times of danger or exile.

---

### **Jehovah-Rapha – The Lord Our Healer**  
“…for I, the Lord, am your healer.” (Exodus 15:26 [NASB])  
God does not spread sickness but restores. Sin leads us outside His covering, but in returning, we find healing for body, soul, and spirit.

---

### **Jehovah-Tsidkenu – The Lord Our Righteousness**  
“And this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The Lord our righteousness.’” (Jeremiah 23:6 [NASB])  
Since man cannot attain righteousness, God provided His own through Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach), who became our righteousness.

---

### **Jehovah-Shalom – The Lord Is Peace**  
“Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and named it The Lord is Peace.” (Judges 6:24 [NASB])  
In Christ we no longer live in fear, for He Himself is our peace, reconciling us to God.

---

### **Jehovah-Sabaoth – The Lord of Hosts**  
“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory.” (Isaiah 6:3 [NASB])  
God is the commander of heaven’s armies. His holiness fills the earth, assuring us that His power is greater than any enemy.

---

### **Jehovah-Gmolah – The God of Recompense**  
“…For this is the Lord’s time of vengeance; He is going to render recompense to her.” (Jeremiah 51:6 [NASB])  
God is just. Nations rise and fall under His judgment, but His people are called to preach liberty in Christ, leaving vengeance to Him.

---

### **El-Elyon – The Most High God**  
“Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth.” (Genesis 14:19 [NASB])  
Above every power, God Most High reigns. The arrogance of Lucifer — “I will make myself like the Most High” (Isaiah 14:14 [NASB]) — is shattered by God’s eternal authority.

---

### **El-Roi – The God Who Sees**  
“You are a God who sees.” (Genesis 16:13 [NASB])  
Hagar’s testimony reminds us: God sees our affliction, and His care extends even to the outcast.

---

### **El-Shaddai – God Almighty**  
“I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless.” (Genesis 17:1 [NASB])  
He is our refuge and fortress (Psalm 91:1–2 [NASB]). His might is perfect strength, covering us under His wings.

---

### **El-Olam – The Everlasting God**  
“Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth does not become weary or tired.” (Isaiah 40:28 [NASB])  
Unlike man, God is unending, tireless, and faithful. He strengthens the weary and gives endurance to His people.

## Application: Knowing His Names, Walking in His Character  
God’s names are not trivia to memorize — they are revelations of His heart. To know that He is **Elohim** is to trust His power. To know Him as **Jehovah-Ra’ah** is to rest in His care. To confess Him as **Jehovah-Tsidkenu** is to walk in His righteousness through Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach). When we commit these names to heart, we anchor our lives not in shifting circumstances but in the eternal God who has revealed Himself.

---

### Summary  
To be Christian is to know the God who has called us. His names reveal His power, His holiness, His care, His justice, and His peace. Each name is fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach), who embodies the fullness of God. When we understand and commit these names to heart, we walk not as children of ignorance but as sons and daughters who know their Father.

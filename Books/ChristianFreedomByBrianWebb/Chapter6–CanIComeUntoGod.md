# Chapter 6: Can I Come Unto God?

## 1 Introduction: Who Can Approach God?

From the beginning, mankind has wrestled with the question: Can I come unto God? Adam and Eve, once walking in direct fellowship with Him, lost that intimacy when they sinned in Eden (Genesis 3:8–10 [NASB]). Sin severed access; unrighteousness deafens ears to God’s voice. Only those declared righteous may truly listen and respond to Him.

The theme of this chapter is simple but profound: righteousness is not earned by the flesh or the Law, but given by God through faith. This is how men and women may come to Him.

## 2 Moses and the Burning Bush

Moses’ first encounter with God came through a burning bush (Exodus 3:2–6 [NASB]). Why? Because man, unrighteous in himself, cannot stand before God directly. A manifestation, a mediated presence, was necessary. Moses was declared righteous not by works of the Law (which had not yet been given), but by believing God.

Romans 4 affirms this principle: righteousness has always come through belief in God’s word, not works.

## 3 Abraham’s Faith Counted as Righteousness

Romans 4:3 [NASB]:
> “For what does the Scripture say? ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.”

Abraham’s righteousness was not based on circumcision (Romans 4:10) or the Law, but simply on believing God’s promise (Genesis 15:6 [NASB]). Paul echoes this again in Galatians 3:6–9, showing Abraham as the father of all who believe, Jew or Gentile.

David’s testimony reinforces this truth: “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered” (Romans 4:7 [NASB], Psalm 32:1–2).

Faith itself — trusting God’s words — is the substance of righteousness.

## 4 The Law’s Role: Boundaries, Not Righteousness

Romans 4:15 [NASB]:
> “For the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.”

The Law was never given as a means of salvation. Instead, as Galatians 3:19-24 [NASB] explains, the Law was added “because of transgressions … until the seed would come.” It exposed sin, set boundaries, and preserved the promise — but it could not grant righteousness.

Only one man, Jesus Christ, could fulfill the Law perfectly. The rest of us fail.

## 5 Enemies Reconciled, Made Friends

Romans 5:1 [NASB]:
> “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

Peace here is the opposite of war. In sin, mankind is at enmity with God. Yet while we were still His enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son (Romans 5:10 [NASB]; Colossians 1:21–22 [NASB]).

This reconciliation is not something we earn; it is something we receive. It is given. We were enemies — yet God chose to make us friends through Jesus Christ.

## 6 Two Laws at Work

Romans 8:2 [NASB]:
> “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.”

At first glance, this can be confusing. Scripture says that the Torah of the LORD is perfect (Psalm 19:7), and Paul himself writes, “So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good” (Romans 7:12 [NASB]). How then can Paul speak of a “law of sin and death”? Is God the author of sin? By no means!

The key is understanding that Paul uses the word "law" in two distinct senses.

* The Torah (Law of the LORD): God’s holy revelation of His will — perfect, righteous, and good.
* The Law of Sin and Death: A principle at work in fallen flesh, where sin hijacks what is good and produces condemnation.

Romans 7:10–11 [NASB] says:

> “And this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me; for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it, killed me.”

The Torah was never evil — the problem is with human flesh. The Torah is like a mirror: it reflects God’s righteousness and shows us our sin, but it cannot heal us. Instead, it exposes transgression and proves our need for a Savior. Thus, when Paul speaks of “the law of sin and death,” he means that principle by which sin, revealed by the Torah, brings condemnation and death.

Against this stands a greater reality: “the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.” Where the Torah exposed sin, Jesus Christ fulfills it perfectly and gives us His Spirit, granting freedom and life. As John 3:6 [NASB] declares: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”

So Paul is not setting the Torah against Christ. He is showing the difference between what the Torah can do (expose sin) and what only Christ can do (set us free and make us righteous).

## 7 Confession and Belief Unto Salvation

Romans 10:9–10 [KJV]: 
> “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”

Here lies the simplicity of the Gospel. The flesh cannot produce righteousness. Christ has already finished the work. Our response is to believe God’s word and confess Jesus Christ as Lord.

## 8 Faith Leading to Righteousness

Romans 15:13 [NASB]:
> “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”

Faith produces peace, joy, and hope. Hebrews 11 reminds us that men and women of old — Abraham, Moses, Rahab, and others — gained approval not by law-keeping, but by faith. Their lives show us that faith is the doorway to communion with God. The consistent thread is this: righteousness has always been by faith, not by works of the Law. The Law itself pointed to this truth, and the faithful of old bore witness.

Hebrews 11 provides a sweeping testimony:
* Abel: “By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was attested to be righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.” (Hebrews 11:4 [NASB])
* Enoch: “By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for before he was taken up, he was attested to have been pleasing to God. And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:5–6 [NASB])
* Noah: “By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.” (Hebrews 11:7 [NASB])
* Abraham: “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he left, not knowing where he was going.” (Hebrews 11:8 [NASB]) … “By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and the one who had received the promises was offering up his only son; it was he to whom it was said, ‘Through Isaac your descendants shall be named.’” (Hebrews 11:17–18 [NASB])
* Moses: “By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.” (Hebrews 11:24–26 [NASB])

These witnesses demonstrate that faith is not a New Testament invention, but the eternal principle by which God justifies His people. The Law never replaced faith; rather, it highlighted the necessity of it.

## 9 Practical Application: Read Romans Whole

The book of Romans is best read as a flowing letter, not a chopped-up rulebook. Chapters, verses, and punctuation are modern constructs. Read it through three times:

* The first time, you will have many questions.
* The second time, you will start to see Paul’s patterns.
* The third time, it will begin to come together.

Read it as Paul wrote it — a Spirit-filled letter declaring the righteousness of God given by faith.

## 10 Summary

Can I come unto God? Yes, but not by the works of flesh or the keeping of the Law. Access to God is through righteousness imputed by faith, just as Abraham and Moses believed God and were counted righteous. Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law, reconciled enemies, and opened the way into life through the Spirit. The call is simple: believe God’s words, confess Jesus as Lord, and walk in the Spirit.
